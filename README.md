Using SVM, MLP and RBF for predicting protein targets

Proteins  are the fundamental building blocks of life taking part in the majority of the functions in the cell and when they malfunction as a result of various genetic or external factors they often cause disease. It is the objective of drug therapy to target defective proteins by providing chemical structures that to some extent will alleviate the loss of protein function. In this work we describe our methods for predicting new protein targets using a neural network based classifier. Protein targets and protein non-targets are identified and labeled accordingly using data from HINT, OMIM databases, both types of proteins are annotated with biological knowledge from the gene ontology. Our intention is to discover the biological differences between target and non target proteins and to make available to medicine a new list of viable, targetable proteins that may be treatable for various diseases in the future. SVM and MLP networks were trained on this data providing an accuracy of 80\% on the test data, we validate the identified target proteins using evidence from the literature and other sources.
